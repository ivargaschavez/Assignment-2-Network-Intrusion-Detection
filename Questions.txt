Question #1
Why is it necessary to identify malicious hosts in order to stop port scans in real traffic? 
Why isn't identifying SYN-only flows sufficient?

Question #2
Choose 2 IP addresses in the set of "malicious hosts" and see what you can find out about them

Question #3
A threshold of 100 is the default for the Bro algorithm. 
Given the results in your sensitivity curve plot, why do you think this value was chosen? 
What are the pros and cons of choosing a higher or lower threshold?

Question #4
A threshold of 100 would have blocked ~115 hosts (if your implementation didn't, 
you should check it for bugs). This is many fewer hosts than the number of malicious hosts 
found in Part 3. What differences between the Bro algorithm and the method used in Part 3 
caused this difference? Which method do you think is more likely to be accurate? Why?
